# Documentation Index

Core documentation has been integrated into `README.md` in the repository root. This file serves to guide supplementary resources under the `docs/` directory.

## Quick Navigation
- `../README.md`: Complete project overview, detection principles, and latest detection logs
- `device-database/`: Calibration samples, database structure, and regression test output

## Recommended Reading Order
1. First read the root `README.md` to understand detection flow and technical details
2. View samples and calibration outputs under `docs/device-database/` as needed
3. Use scripts in `tools/` to complete calibration and validation

To add new documentation, place it in this directory and update the index here.
